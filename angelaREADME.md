---Pie Chart---
We ended up scrapping the idea entirely, but I just wanted to post my reference links anyway as it was good to learn how to make a piechart with javasccript

https://canvasjs.com/html5-javascript-pie-chart/
I used the link above on how to set up an interactive pie chart via javascript. Knowing this code, I can now be able to
create pie charts like this in the future (something cool to learn). I would most likely use Canvas in the future as well <!-- <script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script> -->

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp
I used the link above in order to make the tabs for the piechart and the recommendations. I didn't really know how to use tabs before, so I pretty much followed this code step by step and doing my best to understand how it works.

Used this to help explain maps in javascript so that I can make a reference via key in order to "color" the genres.

---What I Used---

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp
I used the link above to learn how to make a table in html. I never made one before, so this was a new concept that is good to learn for the future. I believe tables are commonly used for websites, so getting the basics down now is very helpful.
